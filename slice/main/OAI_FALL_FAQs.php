          <div class="item-hd color-c"><h4>I'm an Oklahoma public school teacher. How can I receive a full scholarship to OFAI?</h4></div>
          <div class="item-bd">
            <p>Individuals currently employed as Oklahoma public school teachers and administrators automatically receive full scholarships to OFAI upon enrollment, while supplies last. Scholarships include tuition and room and board.</p>
            <p>Scholarships are provided by the Oklahoma State Department of Education and private donors. Additional funding is provided by the Oklahoma Arts Council.</p>
            <p>Educators are responsible for a non-refundable $30 registration fee, and visual arts classes have a $30 studio fee. Scholarships and workshop space are administered on a first come, first served basis, so enroll as soon as possible!</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, substitute teachers do not qualify for scholarships.</p>

          <div class="item-hd color-c"><h4>I'm an Oklahoma PRIVATE school teacher. How much does it cost for me to attend?</h4></div>
          <div class="item-bd">
            <p>Oklahoma private school educators receive a 50% discount on OFAI tuition. Please visit our Tuition and Enrollment page for more details about cost of attendance.</p>

          <div class="item-bd">
            <p>Most people will miss only two days of work. Participants check in from noon-1 pm on Thursday and check out at 10:30 a.m. on Sunday.</p>
            <p>The vast majority of school districts support teachers’ OFAI attendance and provide substitutes. Local educational foundations may assist with attaining substitutes.</p>

          <div class="item-hd color-c"><h4>What is the enrollment deadline?</h4></div>
          <div class="item-bd">
            <p>There is no enrollment deadline. You may enroll as long as there is space available in your chosen workshop. Workshops fill quickly, so enroll as soon as possible!</p>

        <div class="item-content">
          <div class="item-hd color-c"><h4>How does the waiting list work?</h4></div>
          <div class="item-bd">
            <p>Each Oklahoma public school educator is eligible to attend one workshop on scholarship. Scholarships are not guaranteed. If no scholarships are available at the time of enrollment, you can choose a different workshop and/or be placed on a waiting list. You can be placed on the waiting lists of up to three workshops through our online enrollment system, and we strongly recommend educators take advantage of the wait list system. Many waitlisted applicants are accepted every year. If no scholarships are available, public educators can attend at the rate paid by private educators. But please be aware public educators who decide to enroll in a class by paying the private educator rate will not be eligible for a scholarship during the current year should one become available. Please see the <a href="#">Tuition and Enrollment</a> page for rates.</p>

            <p>All participant rooms are double occupancy. If space allows, private rooms are available for an additional $100 fee.</p>

            <p>The Institute office must be notified of all guests. Participants wishing to bring and share a room with a non-participant guest may do so at an additional cost. Participants bringing nonparticipant guests are responsible for paying the $100 private room fee plus the necessary guest fees. All guest fees include lodging & meals for the duration of the weekend. If the guest is an adult (18 or over), the fee is an additional $75; if the guest is a child (ages 3-17), the fee is an additional $50. Please understand that unattended children are prohibited at OFAI, and children may not attend classes. Guests not staying overnight may dine in the lodge dining room at their own expense; meal tickets are available for purchase at the front desk of the lodge. Although guests are never allowed to attend classes during OFAI, they are welcome to attend faculty presentations and yoga classes.</p>
