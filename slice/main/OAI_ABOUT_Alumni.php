          <p>For 40 years, Oklahoma’s most talented high school students have gathered at Quartz Mountain for two weeks
            every summer, studying with nationally renowned artists in an atmosphere of arts immersion. As students form
            friendships, meet mentors, and hone their skills, they make memories of OSAI that last a lifetime. Many OSAI
            alumni enjoy successful artistic careers, while others choose different career paths. Whether our alumni
            pursue the arts or not, they credit their experiences at OSAI with giving them the discipline and
            self-confidence they need to become successful, well-rounded citizens. This year, 271 new OSAI students
            joined
            the talented, worldwide network of OSAI alumni.

            Since 1983, over 5,000 educators and adult artists have attended the Oklahoma Fall Arts Institute at Quartz
            Mountain. Many OFAI participants pass on the knowledge they gained at Quartz Mountain to thousands of
            Oklahoma
            schoolchildren, reaching an average of 50,000 students each year. Amateur and professional artists who
            attend
            OFAI enrich the artistic culture of the region and the nation.</p>

                <div class="item-inner-bd">
                  <p>One of our many wildly successful alumni, Megan Mullally, studied mime at OSAI in 1977. Megan is
                    best known for her Emmy and SAG Award-winning role of “Karen Walker” on NBC’s <i>Will & Grace</i>.</p>

                  <p>Megan’s OSAI experience had quite an impact on her:</p>

                  <p><i>“Quartz Mountain is a very creative atmosphere where everyone is inspired, but when you get a group
                      of like-minded people together in an intense setting, it has to be good!! The study of mime was a
                      tool which helped me loosen up and become more in touch with my physicality – both of which are of
                      primary importance in acting. Most importantly, the Oklahoma Summer Arts Institute came at a special
                      time in my life. It put me in a state and mood to continue my art before I was to venture off to
                      college. Thanks OSAI!”</i></p>
