          <h4>Support the Oklahoma Arts Institute</h4>
          <p>As a national model for excellence in public/private partnerships, the Oklahoma Arts Institute is grateful for its strong and long-lasting relationship with the State of Oklahoma. Nevertheless, private donations from corporations, foundations, individuals, and arts and civic organizations remain the lifeblood of the organization’s funding. Each dollar invested by the State Department of Education and the Oklahoma Arts Council must be matched by private dollars raised by OAI. The Oklahoma Arts Institute is committed to raising scholarships for every student and public educator attending the summer and fall programs. The Oklahoma Arts Institute will work with you to find the most efficient, personally satisfying, and financially advantageous way to make a contribution. Many donors choose to give unrestricted gifts to fund the Arts Institute’s programs and projects of the highest priority. Contributors may also designate or restrict gifts for specific programs or projects that reflect the donor’s personal interests. All contributions are tax-deductible to the extent provided by the law. The Oklahoma Arts Institute accepts the following types of donations:</p>

          <div class="item-bd">
            <p>A gift of cash is the simplest method of supporting the Oklahoma Arts Institute. Many corporations match the gifts their employees make to the Institute, thereby doubling the value of the gift. Donors should consult their employers to determine if such programs are offered. Checks should be made payable to “Oklahoma Arts Institute” and mailed to: 111 NW 9th Street, Oklahoma City, OK 73102. All donation amounts are appreciated, but donors of $250 or more qualify as OAI Members  and are invited to attend various events throughout the year, including Visitors’ Day at Quartz Mountain during the Oklahoma Summer Arts Institute in June.  Donors may choose to contribute at the following membership levels:</p>

          <div class="item-bd">
            <p>The Oklahoma Arts Institute Foundation oversees an endowment fund with the sole purpose of supporting the programs of the Oklahoma Arts Institute in perpetuity. Donors may establish a named endowment fund to honor a loved one, friend, or mentor. Many donors choose to establish scholarship funds for students to attend the Summer Arts Institute or for educators to attend the Fall Arts Institute. Donors often continue to increase their named endowment funds with annual contributions. Only the interest generated by the investment of principal is used to support programs.</p>

          <div class="item-bd">
            <p>Stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, and other securities may be donated to the Oklahoma Arts Institute. Gifts of securities may prove especially advantageous for the donor, since the donor receives a charitable deduction based on the value of the securities at the time of transfer and is also relieved of paying taxes on any gain in the value of the securities.  The policy of the Institute’s Board of Directors is to immediately liquidate securities upon receipt.</p>

          <div class="item-bd">
            <p>Donors may choose to contribute commercial or residential property to the Oklahoma Arts Institute. All gifts of property are subject to the approval of the Institute’s Board of Directors.</p>

          <div class="item-bd">
            <p>An increasingly popular method of giving is the charitable remainder trust, of which there are two varieties: the charitable remainder unitrust and the charitable remainder annuity trust. Both can be funded through a gift during a donor’s lifetime or through a testamentary disposition. Both provide life income for the donor and/or designated beneficiaries. Life Insurance can become a gift of much greater value than the actual money expended when the policy is given to the Institute, which is named the beneficiary. The donor may choose to pay up the entire policy or make annual contributions to the Institute for the cost of the premiums. The Oklahoma Arts Institute is often named a beneficiary in the wills or living trusts of Institute alumni and friends. The donor may elect to leave all or part of an estate to benefit the Institute.</p>
