                <div class="item-inner-bd">
                  <p>A native of Norman, Emily holds a degree from the University of Oklahoma, where she was initiated into Pe-Et, an honor given to the university’s top ten seniors. After graduation, she moved to Boston and worked at Brigham & Women’s Hospital. Emily served as president of the board for the Center for Children & Families in Norman upon return to Oklahoma, and currently serves on the advisory committee for the Oklahoma State Fair’s Visual Arts Scholarship Event. Her family’s ties to Norman include a longstanding involvement in the local arts community, which has given Emily a deep appreciation for the arts. Her personal artistic experience has been well-rounded, pursuing interests in dance, photography, and acting. But Emily found her true calling when she began working at the Oklahoma Arts Institute in 2005. She has been creating educational opportunities for others for over nine years and continually strives to feel half as interesting as the talented artists she meets every year.</p>
